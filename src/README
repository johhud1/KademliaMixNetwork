Bugs:
	1. When nodes leave the network and then rejoin at same address/port. 
	Even though they have new ids, when other nodes query for live nodes, 
	that new node will respond to requests sent to it, causing it to appear that all those old nodes are still live. 
	fix- not sure; if we include a 'reciever' field in the FindNodeRequest struct, 
	then can just check that against our own contact info. respond false if they don't match. 
	Have 'kinda' fixed this by 5 minute expire on stored values (old contacts expire)

	2.  GeneratePath seems to be trying to find a lot fo disconnected drymartinis. Should only be searching for live nodes.


Features:
	1. Need to add a real testing system/framework.
